<li> For all the faithful: That our response to this dark episode will
result in even stronger faith that Christ will rebuild His Church and

sin abounds, grace abounds all the more; and may we renew our
commitment to participate in the sacraments, learn the faith, join our
parish communities, and serve the poor and marginalized. We pray, </li>

<li>For non-Catholics who may be tempted to disparage Catholics,

Catholics. We pray,</li>
